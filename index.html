    <P>Folktales and myths serve as a means of handing down traditions and customs from one generation to the next in Africa. <br> 
        For several generations, stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth. <br> Often, after a hard dayâ€™s work, the adults would gather the children together by moonlight, around a village fire and tell stories. <br> This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'. Usually, the stories are meant to prepare young people for life, and so each story taught a lesson or moral. 
        
        In the African folktales, the stories reflect the culture where diverse types of animals abound. <br> The animals and birds are often accorded human attributes, so it is not uncommon to find animals talking, singing, or demonstrating other human characteristics such as greed, jealousy, honesty, etc. <br> The setting in many of the stories exposes the reader to the land form and climate within that region of Africa. <br> References are often made to different seasons such as the 'dry' or 'rainy' season and their various effects on the surrounding vegetation and animal life.
